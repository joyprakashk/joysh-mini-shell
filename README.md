```

Production-grade UNIX shell written in C with support for process execution, pipelines, redirection, background jobs and signal handling.

Built to demonstrate Linux systems programming concepts including process lifecycle management, inter-process communication, file descriptor manipulation and UNIX shell architecture.

## Features

* Interactive shell runtime
* Command parsing and tokenization
* External command execution via `fork()` + `execvp()`
* Built-in commands:

  * `cd`
  * `pwd`
  * `exit`
  * `history`
  * `clear`
  * `stats`
* Multi-stage pipelines
* Input/output redirection
* Background process execution
* Signal handling (`SIGINT`, `SIGTSTP`)
* Command logging and execution metrics
* Dockerized runtime environment
* Modular subsystem architecture

## Testing

```bash
chmod +x tests/test.sh
./tests/test.sh
```

Memory leak checks:

```bash
make valgrind
```

---

## Build Targets

```bash
make
make clean
make debug
make release
make valgrind
```

---

## Design Goals

* POSIX-oriented implementation
* Explicit process lifecycle handling
* Minimal runtime overhead
* File descriptor correctness
* Modular subsystem isolation
* Reproducible containerized runtime

---

## Current Limitations

* No job control (`fg`, `bg`, `jobs`)
* No readline integration
* No wildcard/globbing expansion
* No shell scripting support
* No environment variable expansion
